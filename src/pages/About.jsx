          <p>
            Hello! I'm Matthew Thurber, a web developer with a background in finance. I am passionate about creating
            engaging and user-friendly web applications. My journey into web development started with a curiosity
            to combine my analytical skills from finance with the boundless creativity of web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my projects, I strive to deliver solutions that not only meet technical requirements but also provide
            a positive and seamless user experience. I enjoy learning new technologies and staying up-to-date with the
            latest trends in web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, travelling and camping, or playing Fortnite with my wife.
